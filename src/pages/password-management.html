          In the digital world, passwords are a combination of keyboard
          characters provided by users, while creating a web account. This would
          serve as an access key to its contained data. To gain access(Log in)
          to a user account, web pages require the account username and
          password. These accounts could hold sensitive data, making their
          security of great importance. In this article, we would educate you on
          the best password management practices, to prevent unauthorized access
          to your data.

        <p class="technical-wb-p">
          Firstly, we would discuss some of the challenges to password
          management, or ways cybercriminals gain access to our web accounts;
        </p>
        <img

          alt="hacking password image"
        />
        <ul>
          <li>
            Login Spoofing: This is a process whereby cybercriminals create a
            fake page to clone or look like our usually visited web pages.
            Thereby storing a user's password when they try to gain access to
            their accounts.
          </li>
          <li>
            Sniffing Attack: Here, passwords are stolen by intercepting data
            while in transit through a network with tools.
          </li>
          <li>
            Shoulder surfing attack: This can be defined as any form of stealing
            a password as it is typed in e.g with the use of a micro camera.
          </li>
          <li>
            Brute force attack: A brute force attack uses a trial and error
            method to gain access to a user's account. It is performed by
            calculating possible combinations to get passwords.
          </li>
          <li>
            Data Breach: A data breach can be said to be when access is
            illegally gotten to a web database. This allows these cybercriminals
            to steal data contained on these websites.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="technical-wb-p">
          Furthermore, we would discuss how we can prevent unauthorized access
          to our web accounts/data.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Choose a strong password: To ensure our passwords are strong, we
            must ensure they include;
            <br />-Numbers <br />-Symbols <br />-Capital Letter
          </li>

          <li>
            Change passwords often: To ensure our passwords are secure, we must
            change them at least once every quarter year.
          </li>
          <li>
            Use two-factor authentication: This requires web accounts to request
            an input PIN usually sent to the account ownerâ€™s provided email
            address or phone number. This does not only protect a user from
            password theft but also ensures his/her knowledge of any new device
            access to their account.
          </li>
          <li>
            Keep your information online: Users are advised to sign out of their
            accounts after use and remove permissions of applications that are
            not in use.
          </li>
          <li>
            Invest in account security products: Investing in these products
            would keep user accounts secure whilst also alerting them to any
            security issues on our accounts. It also informs us of malicious
            link posts and fraudulent accounts impersonating us.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="technical-wb-p">
          Lastly, we would discuss what to do when your web accounts are hacked:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Take back control of the account with the laid-out steps and change
            passwords and security questions.
          </li>
          <li>Warn your contacts for damage control.</li>
          <li>
            Look for signs of trouble, or how you got hacked if corrections are
            necessary.
          </li>
          <li>Protect yourself for the future.</li>
        </ol>
