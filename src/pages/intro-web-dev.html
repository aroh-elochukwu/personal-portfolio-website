        <p class="technical-wb-datetag">Author: Elochukwu Aroh</p>
        <p class="technical-wb-datetag">Date: Friday, 8th April 2022</p>
        <p class="technical-wb-p">
          The term web development can be said to be the process of building and
          maintaining websites. It involves a host of work to ensure ideas are
          transferred to look great and work optimally. This is done by creating
          a set of commands to the computer in languages they understand to
          deliver the desired user experience.
        </p>
        <p class="technical-wb-p">
          These processes in web development can be classed into two namely;
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Front-end development.</li>
          <li>Back-end development.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Front-End Web Development</h2>
        <p class="technical-wb-p">
          This covers the layout, design, and interactivity of a website. It
          involves the transfer of ideas into a graphical interface with
          programming languages, so a user can communicate with data on the
          website. These languages could vary depending on the task a programmer
          is trying to accomplish and they include HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
        </p>
        <p class="technical-wb-p">
          Hypertext Markup Language (HTML): This can be defined as symbols or
          codes inserted with files a developer adds to a website, explaining
          how these files are viewed by users. These are usually sub-grouped
          into the head for defining the document characteristics and body
          section for the actual description for our pages to visiting
          computers.
        </p>
        <p class="technical-wb-p">
          HTML is usually written with reference tags for easy machine and human
          co-understanding encased in lesser than and greater than signs “&lt;
          &gt;”. These HTML tags e.g. &lt;header&gt;, &lt;article&gt; helps
          define every entity of this document.
        </p>
        <p class="technical-wb-p">
          When an HTML tag is defining or encasing data or a file, it is called
          an HTML element. This is because now it is an individual or
          stand-alone component of the web document. These elements usually have
          an opening tag and a closing tag indicating their opening and closing
          as shown below:
        </p>
        <p class="code-text">&lt;p&gt; This is a paragraph &lt;/p&gt;</p>
        <p class="technical-wb-p">
          HTML elements are subdivided into inline and block elements,
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Inline Element: These elements like their name are inline, thereby
            do not start a new line of codes and take up just enough space as
            its contents require e.g &lt;span&gt;, &lt;br&gt;.
          </li>
          <li>
            Block Element: These codes always begin a new line and take up the
            full width of space their content requires, except when altered with
            CSS. Examples include &lt;article&gt;, &lt;video&gt;.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p class="technical-wb-p">
          HTML may sometimes need to provide additional information for its
          elements with the help of its attributes. These HTML attributes are
          added in the opening tags and come in name/value pairs like:
          “attribute-name = “attribute-value” ” as shown below:
        </p>
        <p class="code-text">&lt;img src= “my_pic.jpg”&gt; &lt;/img&gt;</p>
        <p class="technical-wb-p">
          Cascading Style Sheet (CSS): This can be defined as a system in which
          styling is added to web pages. Thereby controlling the positioning,
          and presentation of these pages, including their fonts, colors,
          layouts, and how a page is adapted to fit different user device
          screens. This is done by selecting individual elements of a page and
          defining the styling one would want to attribute to it.
        </p>
        <p class="technical-wb-p">
          We achieve this by calling the HTML element one would like to style
          and defining the characteristics to be implemented in them. These
          elements are called with the use of CSS selectors i.e. a name the HTML
          can be identified with. While the process of calling and defining
          styles on an HTML element is said to be the CSS rule. This is further
          illustrated below;
        </p>
        <p class="code-text">
          Div { Border : 1px Solid Red;
          <br />
          Font-size : 5px; }
        </p>
        <p class="technical-wb-p">
          As shown above, each attribute attached to an HTML element comes with
          a value to define how much of them is attached to the element, this is
          called the CSS value.
        </p>
        <p class="technical-wb-p">
          For Vol. II of this series we would be discussing the next ammunition
          in the web development series, JavaScript. Here we would learn to add
          functionalities to our websites.
