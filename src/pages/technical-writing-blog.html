        <h1 class="technical-wb-h1">Password Management</h1>
        <p class="technical-wb-p">
          In the digital world, passwords are a combination of keyboard
          characters provided by users, while creating a web account. This would
          serve as an access key to its contained data. To gain access(Log in)
          to a user account, web pages require the account username and
          password. These accounts could hold sensitive data, making their
          security of great importance. In this article, we would educate you on
          the best password management practices, to prevent unauthorized access
          to your data.
        </p>
        <img src="../images/login-image.jpg" alt="log in page image" />
        <p class="technical-wb-p">
          Firstly, we would discuss some of the challenges to password
          management, or ways cybercriminals gain access to our web accounts;
        </p>
        <img
          src="../images/online-password-hacker.png"
          alt="hacking password image"
        />
        <ul>
          <li>
            Login Spoofing: This is a process whereby cybercriminals create a
            fake page to clone or look like our usually visited web pages.
            Thereby storing a user's password when they try to gain access to
            their accounts.
          </li>
          <li>
            Sniffing Attack: Here, passwords are stolen by intercepting data
            while in transit through a network with tools.
          </li>
          <li>
            Shoulder surfing attack: This can be defined as any form of stealing
            a password as it is typed in e.g with the use of a micro camera.
          </li>
          <li>
            Brute force attack: A brute force attack uses a trial and error
            method to gain access to a user's account. It is performed by
            calculating possible combinations to get passwords.
          </li>
          <li>
            Data Breach: A data breach can be said to be when access is
            illegally gotten to a web database. This allows these cybercriminals
            to steal data contained on these websites.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="technical-wb-p">
          Furthermore, we would discuss how we can prevent unauthorized access
          to our web accounts/data.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Choose a strong password: To ensure our passwords are strong, we
            must ensure they include;
            <br />-Numbers <br />-Symbols <br />-Capital Letter
          </li>

          <li>
            Change passwords often: To ensure our passwords are secure, we must
            change them at least once every quarter year.
          </li>
          <li>
            Use two-factor authentication: This requires web accounts to request
            an input PIN usually sent to the account owner’s provided email
            address or phone number. This does not only protect a user from
            password theft but also ensures his/her knowledge of any new device
            access to their account.
          </li>
          <li>
            Keep your information online: Users are advised to sign out of their
            accounts after use and remove permissions of applications that are
            not in use.
          </li>
          <li>
            Invest in account security products: Investing in these products
            would keep user accounts secure whilst also alerting them to any
            security issues on our accounts. It also informs us of malicious
            link posts and fraudulent accounts impersonating us.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="technical-wb-p">
          Lastly, we would discuss what to do when your web accounts are hacked:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Take back control of the account with the laid-out steps and change
            passwords and security questions.
          </li>
          <li>Warn your contacts for damage control.</li>
          <li>
            Look for signs of trouble, or how you got hacked if corrections are
            necessary.
          </li>
          <li>Protect yourself for the future.</li>

        <h1 class="technical-wb-h1">Introduction to Web Development Vol I,</h1>
        <p class="technical-wb-p">
          The term web development can be said to be the process of building and
          maintaining websites. It involves a host of work to ensure ideas are
          transferred to look great and work optimally. This is done by creating
          a set of commands to the computer in languages they understand to
          deliver the desired user experience.
        </p>
        <p class="technical-wb-p">
          These processes in web development can be classed into two namely;
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Front-end development.</li>
          <li>Back-end development.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Front-End Web Development</h2>
        <p class="technical-wb-p">
          This covers the layout, design, and interactivity of a website. It
          involves the transfer of ideas into a graphical interface with
          programming languages, so a user can communicate with data on the
          website. These languages could vary depending on the task a programmer
          is trying to accomplish and they include HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
        </p>
        <p class="technical-wb-p">
          Hypertext Markup Language (HTML): This can be defined as symbols or
          codes inserted with files a developer adds to a website, explaining
          how these files are viewed by users. These are usually sub-grouped
          into the head for defining the document characteristics and body
          section for the actual description for our pages to visiting
          computers.
        </p>
        <p class="technical-wb-p">
          HTML is usually written with reference tags for easy machine and human
          co-understanding encased in lesser than and greater than signs “&lt;
          &gt;”. These HTML tags e.g. &lt;header&gt;, &lt;article&gt; helps
          define every entity of this document.
        </p>
        <p class="technical-wb-p">
          When an HTML tag is defining or encasing data or a file, it is called
          an HTML element. This is because now it is an individual or
          stand-alone component of the web document. These elements usually have
          an opening tag and a closing tag indicating their opening and closing
          as shown below:
        </p>
        <p class="code-text">&lt;p&gt; This is a paragraph &lt;/p&gt;</p>
        <p class="technical-wb-p">
          HTML elements are subdivided into inline and block elements,
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Inline Element: These elements like their name are inline, thereby
            do not start a new line of codes and take up just enough space as
            its contents require e.g &lt;span&gt;, &lt;br&gt;.
          </li>
          <li>
            Block Element: These codes always begin a new line and take up the
            full width of space their content requires, except when altered with
            CSS. Examples include &lt;article&gt;, &lt;video&gt;.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p class="technical-wb-p">
          HTML may sometimes need to provide additional information for its
          elements with the help of its attributes. These HTML attributes are
          added in the opening tags and come in name/value pairs like:
          “attribute-name = “attribute-value” ” as shown below:
        </p>
        <p class="code-text">&lt;img src= “my_pic.jpg”&gt; &lt;/img&gt;</p>
        <p class="technical-wb-p">
          Cascading Style Sheet (CSS): This can be defined as a system in which
          styling is added to web pages. Thereby controlling the positioning,
          and presentation of these pages, including their fonts, colors,
          layouts, and how a page is adapted to fit different user device
          screens. This is done by selecting individual elements of a page and
          defining the styling one would want to attribute to it.
        </p>
        <p class="technical-wb-p">
          We achieve this by calling the HTML element one would like to style
          and defining the characteristics to be implemented in them. These
          elements are called with the use of CSS selectors i.e. a name the HTML
          can be identified with. While the process of calling and defining
          styles on an HTML element is said to be the CSS rule. This is further
          illustrated below;
        </p>
        <p class="code-text">
          Div { Border : 1px Solid Red;
          <br />
          Font-size : 5px; }
        </p>
        <p class="technical-wb-p">
          As shown above, each attribute attached to an HTML element comes with
          a value to define how much of them is attached to the element, this is
          called the CSS value.
        </p>
        <p class="technical-wb-p">
          For Vol. II of this series we would be discussing the next ammunition
          in the web development series, JavaScript. Here we would learn to add
          functionalities to our websites.

        <h1 class="technical-wb-h1">The Art of Counter Attack in Soccer</h1>
        <p class="technical-wb-p">
          In recent times, the counterattack tactic has become one of the most
          useful arsenals at the disposal of soccer teams. Which has in turn
          created the most underdog victories in the history of the game. This
          is seen where teams sit back and soak pressure from opposing teams,
          with the intention of breaking their defense by initiating a
          fast-paced offense as soon as they get hold of the ball.
        </p>
        <p class="technical-wb-p">
          To achieve the best result with this tactic, it is important to;
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Assign players to defend against each opposing attacker to minimize
            the threat.
          </li>
          <li>
            Assign a defensive midfielder as the first line of protection from
            attack.
          </li>
          <li>
            Train players for swift movement, especially attackers and wingers.
          </li>
          <li>
            Good passers of the ball are very important here especially at
            central midfield, to be able to connect the attackers to initiate an
            attack.
          </li>
          <li>
            Attackers need to be as clinical as possible with available chances,
            as goal chances are going to be limited here.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="technical-wb-p">
          The game plan for your team should be as follows;
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            To attract the opposing team to come at them, by defending deep in
            your half of the field.
          </li>
          <li>Gain possession of the ball.</li>
          <li>
            Wingers and attackers begin looking for loopholes in the opposing
            defense to exploit.
          </li>
          <li>The ball is moved to the central midfielders.</li>
          <li>
            Central Midfielders initiate a pass to the wingers, who then make a
            run with the ball to break the opposing defense.
          </li>
          <li>
            The ball is then moved to the attackers, to make an attempt at the
            opposing team's goal.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="technical-wb-p">
          According to the Pitcher blog, the counterattack is among the six most
          popular soccer tactics. A tabular representation of their list is
          shown below from the most to least;
        </p>

            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
        <p class="technical-wb-p">
          A classic example of this is the Inter-Milan treble-winning team of
          2010. Where they were able to use the counterattack to defeat
          Barcelona in the UEFA Champions League semi-finals, a much better team
          of players on paper. A lot of football fans weren’t too happy with the
          game tactics, but team coach Jose Mourinho replied, “If you have a
          Ferrari and I have a small car, to beat you in a race. I have to break
          your wheel or put sugar in your tank”.
