        <h1 class="about-page-h1">About Me</h1>
        <p class="about-page-p">
          My names are Aroh Innocent Elochukwu, I am the youngest of Six male
          children in a Catholic, loving, Nigerian Home. I am a computer science
          graduate of Benson Idahosa University, who upon graduation went to
          work with the Delta State government as a Data Analyst for its Health
          Insurance Scheme. A while ago, I identified the need to further
          develop my IT skills, to enable my professional growth. Whilst
          plotting my path my elder brother recommended the Manitoba Institute
          of Trades and Technology (MITT) as the next step to reaching these set
          goals. Fast-forward many months later, I am on my laptop writing my
          first assignment for SD 160 (Technical writing Skills) for a Software
          developer degree at MITT.

        <p class="about-page-p">
          Growing up in Southern Nigeria (city of Warri to be precise), IT has
          always appealed to me because of the convenience and efficiency it
          introduced into our lives. Which has spurred every section of life to
          improve upon its prior established ideology, philosophies, and culture
          to yield positive/better outcomes and results. Who would have thought
          that we could sit in front of our computers and host a crystal-clear
          video conference call with crisp audio clarity between people at
          different ends of the World?
        </p>
        <p class="about-page-p">
          I categorize myself as an ambivert whose behavior is mostly dependent
          on where or with whom I am in their company. I am passionate about
          every beautiful thing life has to offer and my hobbies include table
          tennis, soccer, and meeting/interacting with exciting personalities.
