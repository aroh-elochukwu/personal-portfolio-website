        <p class="technical-wb-p">
          In recent times, the counterattack tactic has become one of the most
          useful arsenals at the disposal of soccer teams. Which has in turn
          created the most underdog victories in the history of the game. This
          is seen where teams sit back and soak pressure from opposing teams,
          with the intention of breaking their defense by initiating a
          fast-paced offense as soon as they get hold of the ball.
        </p>
        <p class="technical-wb-p">
          To achieve the best result with this tactic, it is important to;
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Assign players to defend against each opposing attacker to minimize
            the threat.
          </li>
          <li>
            Assign a defensive midfielder as the first line of protection from
            attack.
          </li>
          <li>
            Train players for swift movement, especially attackers and wingers.
          </li>
          <li>
            Good passers of the ball are very important here especially at
            central midfield, to be able to connect the attackers to initiate an
            attack.
          </li>
          <li>
            Attackers need to be as clinical as possible with available chances,
            as goal chances are going to be limited here.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="technical-wb-p">
          The game plan for your team should be as follows;
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            To attract the opposing team to come at them, by defending deep in
            your half of the field.
          </li>
          <li>Gain possession of the ball.</li>
          <li>
            Wingers and attackers begin looking for loopholes in the opposing
            defense to exploit.
          </li>
          <li>The ball is moved to the central midfielders.</li>
          <li>
            Central Midfielders initiate a pass to the wingers, who then make a
            run with the ball to break the opposing defense.
          </li>
          <li>
            The ball is then moved to the attackers, to make an attempt at the
            opposing team's goal.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="technical-wb-p">
          According to the Pitcher blog, the counterattack is among the six most
          popular soccer tactics. A tabular representation of their list is
          shown below from the most to least;
        </p>
        <table>
          <thead>
            <tr>

            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>

              <td>The Counter-Attack</td>
              <td>Real Madrid 2014</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>4</td>
              <td>Park the Bus</td>
              <td>Chelsea 2013</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>5</td>
              <td>The Long Ball Game</td>
              <td>Bolton Wanderers 2004</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>

              <td>The High Press</td>
              <td>Borussia Dortmund 2012</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>

          A classic example of this is the Inter-Milan treble-winning team of
          2010. Where they were able to use the counterattack to defeat
          Barcelona in the UEFA Champions League semi-finals, a much better team
          of players on paper. A lot of football fans weren’t too happy with the
          game tactics, but team coach Jose Mourinho replied, “If you have a
          Ferrari and I have a small car, to beat you in a race. I have to break
          your wheel or put sugar in your tank”.
